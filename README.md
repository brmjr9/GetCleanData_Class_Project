###Readme for UCI HAR Dataset class project for Getting and Cleaning Data

###Repository Contents

This repository includes several files for tidying the UCI HAR Datasets.
* README.md - This file, a brief overview of the elements in the repository
* CodeBook.md - An R Markdown file containg details of the assignment, data sources, and a codebook for the tidyed data.
* run_analysis.R - An R function for taking the data found in the UCI HAR Datasets and creating a tidy combined
   dataset as well as a summary text file (UCI_HAR_Summary.txt)
   
###Analysis Approach

The run_analysis.R script makes a tidy data set from the UCI HAR Dataset found at:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

which is described at URL:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

An R script, run_analysis.r, was created to tidy the data and create an output summary file
called "UCI_HAR_Summary.txt"

It assumes the "UCI HCR Dataset" directory stucture found in the zip file abobe
has been extracted to a work directory without modifications.

The run_analysis script asks for two inputs: the top level UCI HAR Dataset directory location
and a working directory location to place the summary text file into.

On windows, a typical function call inside R might look like:
run_analysis('~/RWork/UCI HAR Dataset','~/Rwork')

The run_analysis.R script uses the dplyr and tidyr data libraries, and after reading in
all the general, test, and train data, follows this procedure:

There are 8 data sets to tidy up:
 * activity_labels (6 x 2 - id and description) 
 * feature_labels (561 x 2 - id and description)
 * X_train and X_test (n x 561 - 561 columns of feature data)
 * y_train and y_test (n x 1 - 1 column of activity ids)
 * subject_train and subject_test (n x 1 - 1 column of subject ids)

The tidying tasks include these steps:
 *1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 *2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 *3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 *4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names 
 *5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This data set should go to a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE.

See the run_analysis.r script for further details of how these tasks are completed.
