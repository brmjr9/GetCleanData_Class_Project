## Class project: Getting and Cleaning Data 

## This R function is a custom function for preparing a tidy data set from 
## the data found at URL:
## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
## which is described at URL:
## http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
## It assumes the "UCI HCR Dataset" directory has been extracted to a work directory.
## It also asks for an output directory for placing a resulting tidy data set. 
##
## On windows, a typical function call might look like:
## run_analysis('~/RWork/UCI HAR Dataset','~/Rwork')

run_analysis <- function(data_directory, output_directory) {
  # 'data_directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
  # the location of the directory "UCI HCR Dataset" extracted
  # from the zip file above.
  # 'output_directory' is a character vector of length 1
  # where the resulting tidy data file will be written.
  # Both must be valid directories.

  # Load the data wrangling libraries
  library(dplyr)
  library(tidyr)
      
  # Save the original working directory
  olddir <- getwd()
    
  # Go to the base data directory and get the activity and feature labels
  print("Loading base data...") 
  setwd(data_directory)
  activity_labels <- read.table('activity_labels.txt',stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  feature_labels <- read.table('features.txt',stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
		
  # Go to the test subdirectory and get the subject, X, and y data
  print("Loading test data...")
  setwd('./test')
  X_test <- read.table('X_test.txt')
  y_test <- read.table('y_test.txt')
  subject_test <- read.table('subject_test.txt')

  # Go to the train subdirectory and get the subject, X, and y data
  print("Loading train data...")
  setwd('../train')
  X_train <- read.table('X_train.txt')
  y_train <- read.table('y_train.txt')
  subject_train <- read.table('subject_train.txt')

  # Go to the output directory before we start creating the tidy data
  print("Making tidy data...")
  setwd(output_directory)

  ## We have 8 data sets to tidy up:
  ##   activity_labels (6 x 2 - id and description) 
  ##   feature_labels (561 x 2 - id and description)
  ##   X_train and X_test (n x 561 - 561 columns of feature data)
  ##   y_train and y_test (n x 1 - 1 column of activity ids)
  ##   subject_train and subject_test (n x 1 - 1 column of subject ids)
  ## Tasks (not necessarily in this order):
  ##   1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  ##   2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  ##   3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  ##   4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names 
  ##   5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the 
  ##      average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  ##      This data set should go to a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE.
